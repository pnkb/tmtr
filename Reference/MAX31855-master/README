This is the GitHub source code repository for the Arduino MAX31855 library and example code for Arduino.

This library offers advantages over other MAX31855 libraries:
a. Returns both the junction (IC) and thermocouple temperatures
b. Handles negative temperatures
c. Returns thermocouple error codes, like open, short-to-ground and short-to-vcc
d. Returns an error if the MAX31855 isn’t communicating (wiring issue?)

In this folder are:

3. MAX31855—2-schematic.png - Hardware schematic for the dual MAX31855 board
4. MAX31855—4-schematic.png - Hardware schematic for the quad MAX31855 board
5. MAX31855 folder - the Arduino library and example code for driving the MAX31855
